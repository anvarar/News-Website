   <h1>Rahul Gandhi’s reinstatement: Adhir Chowdhury hands over SC order, letter to LS secretariat</h1>
   <p>A day after the Supreme Court stayed the conviction of Rahul Gandhi in a 2019 criminal defamation case paving the way for the restoration of his Lok Sabha membership, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury Saturday handed over the Court order and a letter seeking the senior Congress leader’s reinstatement to the Lok Sabha Secretariat.
   He, however, expressed sadness that the Lok Sabha secretariat is not reinstating Rahul Gandhi with the same speed and alacrity with which it had disqualified him from the House in March following his conviction by a Surat court. The Congress is keen that Rahul Gandhi return to the House soon and take part in the no-confidence motion which will be taken up for discussion Tuesday.
   Soon after the apex court order came out Friday, Chowdhury met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla urging him to restore Rahul Gandhi’s membership. The Speaker had told Chowdhury that he would take a call once his office received the order from the Supreme Court.

   “After I received the court order, I called the Speaker Friday night. I told him that I wanted to hand over the Supreme Court order staying the conviction of Rahul Gandhi and also submit our letter. I sought time to meet him. He told me that he would meet me on Saturday,” Chowdhury told reporters.
   “I called him on Saturday morning. I spoke to him. He advised me to contact the Lok Sabha Secretary General and hand over the document to his office. I called the Secretary General. The Secretary General said his office is shut today as it was a holiday. I asked who should I give the letter to then? He told me to give it to the Speaker which will reach him through the Speaker’s office,” Chowdhury said.</p>
