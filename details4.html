    <h1>ISRO transfers satellite bus technology to Bengaluru-based private firm</h1>
    <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Friday announced that it began transferring IMS-1 Satellite Bus technology to Alpha Design Technologies, a Bengaluru-based private company. The transfer was facilitated by ISROâ€™s commercial arm NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) through an agreement that was signed on Wednesday.
    This technology signals the beginning of increased private participation in the Indian space industry. The IMS-1 satellite bus was developed by the UR Rao Satellite Centre and is a small satellite platform designed to enable low-cost access to space. The bus can serve as a dedicated vehicle for many different payloads, facilitating Earth imaging, ocean and atmospheric studies, microwave remote sensing and space science missions.
    The IMS-1 bus weighs about 100 kilograms and can carry a 30-kilogram payload. The solar arrays onboard generate 330 watts of power. It comes with four reaction wheels with a 1 Newton thruster that is good for pointing accuracy with an accuracy threshold of 0.1 Degrees. It was used in previous ISRO missions like IMS-1, Youthsat and Microsat-2D.

    By transferring technologies like IMS-1, ISRO and the Department of Space hope to strengthen industrial growth in the space sector by making it easier for private companies to build and deploy space technology solutions.</p>
