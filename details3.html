  <h1>As host of India-Pak World Cup game, Ahmedabad has a chance to change perception</h1>
  <p>It was during those chaotic months before the 2010 Commonwealth Games, that the then Sports Minister MS Gill made a statement that till date offers respite to all sports administrators fighting deadlines in run-up to high-profile events. Tired of answering questions about the unfinished stadiums and umpteen organisations snafus, the bureaucrat turned parliamentarian made a prophecy that more or less came true.
  “Never mind the delays. Like a seemingly disorganised arrangement in an Indian marriage – just like in the movie ‘Monsoon Wedding’ – we will have a grand Games,” Gill had said.
  Like the Delhi CWG 2010, India gets ready for another October wedding and not everything is going according to plan. Cricket’s oldest and biggest rock show, the 50 overs World Cup, is barely two months away but the fans still wait for the final modified schedule. While coming to terms with the flight cancellation losses, they keep their fingers crossed to deal with the suspense over match-day ticket sales.</p>
