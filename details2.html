  <h1>Elon Musk steals more Twitter handles, domain war with OpenAI: What’s brewing at X?</h1>
  <p>A few weeks ago, we reported how Elon Musk reportedly did not pay the original owner of the handle @X. Well, now it seems Chief Twit is at it again. Even as Twitter enters the final laps of its transformation of its rebranded self as X, several more handles seem to have been taken over by Musk.
  In July, after Musk announced the rebranding of Twitter as X and ditched the history bluebird logo, questions were swirling around what will be the official handle henceforth. However, adding to the pandemonium, Musk went on to take over the X handle which was owned by Sana Francisco-based photographer Gene X Hwang. While the photographer’s hopes to be remunerated for the sudden usurpation, there were reports that suggested that no such attempt were made by the 52-year-old billionaire.Cut to August, now it seems Musk’s platform has gone on to take over handles like @music, @sports, etc. The company has also been rebranding some of the accounts as @Twittermusic, @twittermovies, @twittersports, @twittertv, etc. A user identified as Jeremy Vaught said that he created the @music handle some 16 years ago, and that he has been running it ever since. However, now the handle has been taken over by Musk.
  “16 years ago, I created @music and have been running it ever since. Just now, Twitter / X just ripped it away. Super pissed,” tweeted Vaught. Meanwhile, X also took over @movies and @tv handles and renamed it.</p>
